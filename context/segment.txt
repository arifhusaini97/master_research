force which enhances the velocity of the fluid, hence increasing the heat transfer between the
surface and the fluid, leads to a lower temperature.
Meanwhile in Figure 8 and Figure 9, the effect of the magnetic parameter, M , to local skin

are displayed respectively. It is

revealed that both the local skin friction coefficient and Nusselt number increases with the
increase in magnetic parameter. Since the magnetic field increases the velocity of the fluid, the
heat transfers ability becomes better, hence higher Nusselt number for higher value of magnetic
parameter. From the figures, it can be observed that the solution exists only when the

  c  1.6446 for M  0 . When the value of the magnetic parameter increases, the range
for the  also increases such that when M  0.1 (   c  1.9694 ) and M  0.2
(   c  2.5073 ).

Effects of Slip Velocity and Critical Shear Rate Parameters on Velocity Problem

and Temperature Problem, Local Skin Friction Coefficient, and Nusselt Number

The impact of different values of velocity slip ( L1 ), critical shear rate parameters ( L2 ) with the
default value sets to 1  2  3  0.1, M  0.2, 1  0.5, and E1  0.8 . on velocity profile,
f '( ) can be seen in Figure 10. The velocity of the ternary nanofluid fluid for the first solution

increases with the increase in both slip velocity and critical shear rate parameters while the
velocity profile for the second solution decreases. When velocity slip parameter is applied
( L1  0.5 ), there is less friction between the surface and the fluid due to the slip effect while
the viscosity becomes weaker due to the presence of the critical shear rate parameter
(

L2  0.5, 0.6 )

which

in

higher

velocity.

The

graph

for

L1  L2  0.5 and L1  0.5, L2  0.6 is closer than with the absence of velocity slip and critical

shear rate parameters since there is only a slight difference in L2 . Meanwhile, Figure 11
36

illustrates that as both slip velocity and critical shear rate parameters increases, the temperature
profile,  ( ) , decreases for first and second solution. When both of these parameters increase,
the velocity of the fluid increases, enhancing the heat transfer between the fluid and the surface,
hence, it has lower temperature profile.
Figure 12 shows the effect of slip velocity and critical shear rate parameters on the local skin
1

friction coefficient, C f Re x 2 . When the value of the parameters increases, the local skin
friction for the first solution decreases when   0 while the second solution increases. From
the figure, the local skin friction coefficient is slightly higher when there are no slip velocity
and critical shear rate parameters being applied compared to when the values are
L1  L2  0.5 and L1  0.5, L2  0.6 . On the other hand, Figure 13 reveals that the Nusselt

number, Nu Re x

1

2

, for both solution rises with increasing slip velocity and critical shear rate

parameters. It is observed dual solution exist during shrinking sheet until c , before the
separation boundary layer happens.
