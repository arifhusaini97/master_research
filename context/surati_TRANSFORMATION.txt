Abstract:  A generalized dimensional  analysis method is applied to develop the similarity solution of the steady two dimensional 
boundary layer  flow of non Newtonian fluid Sisko  fluid model with appropriate boundary condition. The non -linear boundary value 
problem (BVP) is transformed into initial value problem (IVP). Taylor series method  is used to solve IVP  .It is observed that velocity 
of set increases with similarity independent variable.

I. INTRODUCTION  
The term fluid includes both gases and liquids. Fluid mechanics deals with the motion of fluids and the 
forces exerted on solid bodies in contact with the fluids.  From last two decades, the study of boundary 
layer flows of non -Newtonian fluids has attracted researcher, Scientists, Mat hematicians and Engineers 
because of its real world applications. A fluid is characterized by the behavior  of its viscosity. Non -
Newtonian behavior  is due to very long chains, coils or a platelet type of molecular structure of the fluids. 
Examples of non -Newtonian fluids are the mud encountered in drilling oil wells, the paper pulp 
suspensions of paper industry, the molten rayon, molten plastics, high polymers, pastes, thick suspensions, 
emulsions, oils and lubricating greases, substances of food industries , slurries, blood etc. Because of 
different properties of non -Newtonian fluids one cannot propose single model so in literature there are 
various model of non -Newtonian fluids available proposed by scientists working in this area.  Observation 
of literature  survey is that most of flow analysis is done for Newtonian fluids and limited analysis done for 
non-Newtonian fluids almost up to power law fluid.Power law fluid model for non -Newtonian fluid have 
been analyzed  by Pakedemirli (1994), Djukic ( 1974 ), Kapur  (1963), Naet al. (1967), Nagler  (2014), Patel 
et al (2011,2012 ). Different fluid models are discussed by Manisha et al. (2013)  
In this paper we have analyzed  the Sisko fluid model proposed by Sisko ( 1958) which is combination of 
viscous and power -law flui d model. Several fluids exist in nature which satisfies the property of shear 
thinning and thickening. Lubricating greases, cement slurries, polymeric suspensions are industrial Sisko 
fluids. In spite of wide industrial applications of Sisko fluid limited work has done in this area. Lie group

 analysis of Sisko  fluid has been done by Gozde and Pakdemirli (2012). Olanrewaju and his co -worker 
(2013) have obtained numerical solution for unsteady free convective flow of Sisko  fluid with radioactive  
heat transfer . Laminar boundary layer flow of Sisko fluid is recently analyzed  using one parameter scaling 
group of transformations by Manisha  Patel (2015).  
So, in this paper our aim is to demonstrate that Generalized dimensional analysis method is  used in 
finding similarity solution of non -Newtonian fluids for Sisko fluid model.  Helmholtz (1973) first 
discovered the concept of ‘Mathematical Similarity’ through the dimensional analysis approach. In the 
same time, the Russian mathematician S. Lie (1975) h as presented famous Lie algorithm based on the 
continuous group transformations for the same kind of simplification of partial differential equation.  
Moran (1971) has worked on the generalized Dimensional Analysis method.  
Further numerical solution is obta ined by transferring BVP to IVP and then applying Taylor’s 
series method. This method of transformation was introduced by Topfer (1957) . Further the method was 
extended to solve many similar type of equation by Klamkin (1962) .by applying linear group of 
transformation, the method was seen to be applicable to Blasius solution with suction or blowing by T.Y. 
Na (1970) .Hema et al has applied a linear group of transformation to convert BVP to IVP in two 
dimensional jet flow.  
II. GOVERNING EQUATIONS  
The Problem of two dimensional laminar boundary layer flow of Sisko  fluid past a semi infinite flat 
plate is examined. The governing continuity and momentum equations of laminar boundary layer flow of 
Sisko  fluid are as follows:

Where     i=1, 2, 3, 4  are group parameters . 
Equations (5) and (6)   remain  invariant under group of transformations defined by G in eq uation (7)

Equations (5) and (6)   remains invariant under group of transformations defined by G in eq uation (7) 
provided     are interrelated in following form.  
                    and                                       (10) 
               and                               (11)

Now according to pi  theorem stated by Moran et el (1972), (given insection -2) the rank of dimensional 
matrix associated with independent and physical variables BC and physical  variables C is required to be 
determined.  
The associated dimensional matrix will be  
BC:  
 
  
 
   where matrix C corresponds last row.  
Rank of matrix BC is two and of matrix C is 1 . (r>s) So by th eorem  3 stated by Moran and Murshek  
n+m+p -r =2 absolute invariant exists in the form of  
  ψ           and                                 (13) 
Solving following  system of equations.

                     (15) 
We obtained exponents        
       
       
      
 . 
So we have similarity transformations

      ψ   
   
                     (17) 
It is to be observed that similarity solutions for all such Non -Newtonian fluids exist only for the flow past 
90° wedge only.

 Using chain  rule of differentiation for  transformations given in equation s (16), (17), (18) equations  (5) -(6) 
are transformed  into ODE in the following form

IV. REDUCTION TO AN INIT IAL VALUE PROBLEM  
A. CASE(I) : NEWTONIAN FLUID MODE L 
 
Put            
  
Equation (19) is transformed as  
                                                (21) 
To transform equation ( 21) with boundary condition into initial value problem a one parameter linear 
group of transformation is defined as under  
                                       (22)      
Where A is parameter of transformation and           are constants which we have to determined  
Substituting the transformation in equation (21 ) 
                                                             
                                
Now under this transformation equation (21 ) must remain invariant it is possible only if  
                   
                                (23) 
To get missing initial condition,  we put  
             
so                           
The boundary condition is independent of          and A if   
                             (24) 
Which then gives                
From  (23) and (24 )       
        
  
Finally,  the value of A can be computed from the boundary condition at the second point, i.e.,         
               
  
          
    
        
                      (25) 
Thus boundary value problem is converted into initial value problem  
                                                     (26) 
With  initial conditions  
                                  again

V. CONCLUSION  
Similarity solutions for steady two dimensional boundary layer equations for Non -Newtonian Sisko 
fluids are derived. The generalized Dimensional Analysis method with two parameter group 
transformation is used to derive similarity solutions. The similarity  equations that are highly non -linear 
ordinary differential equations with boundary conditions are transferred to initial value problem(IVP). The 
numerical solution of resulting IVP is obtained by simple Taylor’s series method. The advantage of 
present ana lysis is that highly non -linear BVP can be solved by simple numerical technique like Taylor’s 
series method  after converting it into IVP. This method c an be applied to the solutions of equations where 
certain parameters appear either in differential equati ons or in boundary conditions.
