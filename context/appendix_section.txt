APPENDICESFormulation for the General Equation ForProblem 1: Powell-Eyring hybrid nanofluid with thermal radiation flow with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) on unsteady Powell-Eyring flow over an inclined plate with thermal radiation.Governing equations:where  is continuity equation,  is momentum equation, and  is energy equation. The boundary layer equations in the form of PDE for the 1st problem is given as:Continuity Equation: Momentum Equation: Energy Equation: where B is magnetic field,Subject to boundary conditions:Where slip parameter, In order to transform PDE - into ODE, the similarity variables  with stream function  and dimensionless temperature  are introduced:Where f is a dimensionless stream function,  is -..Finding u from :Where ` is a differentiation with respect to .Finding v from :To solve continuity equation , find du/dx and dv/dy from  and  respectively,Continuity equation:Thus, the continuity equation  is satisfied. Apply chain rule:Substitutes into the momentum equation :Simplify  by expanding, rearranging, and expressing all terms explicitly in powers of x and derivatives of f.Rearrange all terms in  to one side of the equation and setting the expression equal to zero.Equation  is simplified by grouping like terms, particularly combining the third-order derivative terms and reorganizing the expressionDivides all of the term in  with LetLet Reformulate  by factoring and rearranging terms to explicitly identify physical parameters, simplifying the equation into a dimensionless form suitable for physical interpretation.Divide  with The ODE for the momentum equation:// Don�t use phi (nano particle volume friction)Substitutes into the energy equation :Expend the equation Rearrange Simplify Divides SimplifyReformulate  by factoring and rearranging terms to explicitly identify physical parameters, simplifying the equation into a dimensionless form suitable for physical interpretation.The 2nd order ODE for the energy equation:Boundary conditions at y=0, equation  implies :Assuming,Therefore, the boundary conditions for v is,Assuming, Therefore, the boundary conditions for u is,Divide by Assuming, Therefore, by inserting ,  and  into  , the boundary conditions for  is,//suppose to btta(0)Boundary conditions as , equation  implies  .Boundary conditions as , implies,Boundary conditions as , equation  implies,Reduce  and  to 1st order equation,Try to validate againThe derivation for skin friction coefficient CfLet  into Insert Uw in  into Rewrite  in term of // raynold number keluarkan equation.| rho Ganti dengan rhof The derivation for Nusselt number, NuxHence,Rewrite  in term of // Validate selain Pr.
