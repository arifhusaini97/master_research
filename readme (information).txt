Summary		: "This system is used to study the behavior of water flow in
		   trapezoidal and v-shape channel combining junction."

Description	: "There are two types of water flow channel junction such as 
		   combining and dividing type. Although there are many shapes
		   of open channel, there are only a limited number of studies
		   regarding this field, where most of the studies focusing on
		   water flow in the trapezoidal and rectangular type of channels.
		   The latest related study was conducted by Pandey and Mishra
		   (2012) where they developed a general equation to study the
		   difference between the behavior of water flow at the channel
		   junction for trapezoidal and rectangular type of channels.
		   However, the general equation is not consistent and some
		   parameter may result to complex situations. Hence, this study
		   provides a simpler version of the general equation and make
		   a comparative study between trapezoidal and V-shape channel
		   junction. The effect of the channel and the water physical
		   difference in the behavior of water flow is determined. 
		   MATLAB programming is used to develop a Graphical User
		   Interface (GUI) to solve the model equations. The results
		   of this study will be useful in the field of open channel
		   flow because it can avoid danger of overflowing under flood
		   conditions."
